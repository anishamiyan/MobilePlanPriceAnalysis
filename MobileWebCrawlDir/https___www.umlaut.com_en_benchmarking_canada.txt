What we measure Drivetests and Walktests Our tests cover cities, suburbs, small towns, and highways to provide representative results. Cars and walkers are equipped with the latest smartphones to measure voice and data in 4G and 5G. Voice testing POLQA wideband algorithm measures audio quality. We also simulate typical background data traffic with controlled 100KB data injection. Multi-RAB Multi-RAB (Multi Radio Access Bearer) connectivity determines whether data connectivity is available during the phone calls. Data testing National and international web pages are ranked by Alexa and "Kepler" tests. Files of 10MB and 5MB are uploaded/downloaded from cloud servers. Tests use best-performing mobile plan from each operator. Crowdsourcing Our unique crowdsourcing technology allows us to collect data about real-world experience wherever and whenever customers use their smartphones to consume data services or place phone calls. Network coverage We assess broadband network coverage geographically and by user experience. Time connected to 4G and/or 5G is tracked. Data is aggregated into Evaluation Areas and checked for broadband technology reach and consistency. Data throughputs We analyze crowdsourced data to determine the actual data rates experienced by users, using observed rates within 15-minute slices and active tests.
