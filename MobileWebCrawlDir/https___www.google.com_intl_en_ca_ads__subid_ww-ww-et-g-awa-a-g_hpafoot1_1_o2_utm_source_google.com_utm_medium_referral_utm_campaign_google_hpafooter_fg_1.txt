Claim this offer Terms and conditions for this offer: Offer available only while supplies last. Offer available only to advertisers which are new to Google Ads, with a billing address in Canada. One promotional offer per advertiser. To activate this offer: Click on the button or link associated with this offer for it to be automatically applied to your first Google Ads account. The promotional offer must be applied to your first Google Ads account within 14 days of your first ad impression being served. The promotional offer will only be applied to your account if a payment profile and a valid payment method is added during the initial signup process. To earn the Google Ads credit: After the promotional offer is applied to your Google Ads account, your advertising campaigns must accrue costs of at least $600 CAD (excluding any taxes or applicable fees) within 60 days. Making a payment of $600 CAD is not sufficient. The tracking of advertising costs towards $600 CAD begins after the promotional offer is applied. Once step 5 is completed, provided all eligibility checks are met, the credit will typically be applied within 35 days to the Billing Summary of your Google Ads account. The credit expires 60 days after it is applied to your account. Credit applies to future advertising costs only. Credit cannot be applied to costs accrued before the promotional offer was applied to your Google Ads account. You won’t receive a notification once credit in your Google Ads account is used up and any additional advertising costs will be charged to your form of payment. If you don’t want to continue advertising, you can pause or delete your campaigns at any time. Your account must be successfully billed by Google Ads and remain in good standing in order to remain eligible to use the credit. Google LLC reserves the right to remove the promotional offer from your account if a payment fails, an offer was mistakenly applied, you breach these terms or your account otherwise falls out of good standing. In such cases, if the promotional credit has already been granted, Google LLC reserves the right to nullify that credit.
